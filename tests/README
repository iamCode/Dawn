TESTSUITE:

A testsuite is available for Dawn.
Some steps are required to add this functionality. Also, you could download the pre-built testsuite at the nightly build repository.
''' Please note that you do require tolua++5.1 on your system for this. '''

For building it on Linux:
./configure --with-testsuite
cd scripts
sh run_tolua.sh --with-testsuite
cd ..
make

For building it on Windows:
cd scripts
run_tolua.bat --with-testsuite
compile dawn with your favorite compiler / IDE.
You need to pass -DTESTINTERFACE to your compiler.
compile the testsuite located at tests/testsuite.cpp + h

You can now execute specific tests for dawn running just Dawn.exe or ./dawn-rpg with the --test flag.
Example:
./dawn-rpg --test tests/start_quit.lua

or you can execute the testsuite which will run all tests and evaluate the result.
Execute the testsuite from the dawn root.
